{"name":"Actionsheetpicker-3.0","tagline":"Quickly reproduce the dropdown UIPickerView / ActionSheet functionality from Safari on iPhone/ iOS / CocoaTouch.","body":"Since the [Tim's repo](https://github.com/TimCinel/ActionSheetPicker) is outdated, I forked from this repo and implement a bunch of UI fixes, crush-fixes and different customisation abilites.\r\n\r\nI try to resolve a lot of pull requests and issues in Tim's repo by time, but new updates will be added here.\r\n\r\n`pod 'ActionSheetPicker-3.0', '~> 1.0.9'`\r\n\r\nPlease welcome: **ActionSheetPicker-3.0**, with fix crashes, new pickers and additions!\r\n\r\n*Bug reports, feature requests, patches, well-wishes, and rap demo tapes are always welcome.*\r\n\r\n_Regards, Petr Korolev_\r\n\r\n## ActionSheetPicker = UIPickerView + UIActionSheet ##\r\n\r\nWell, that's how it started. Now, the following is more accurate:\r\n\r\n * _**iPhone/iPod** ActionSheetPicker = ActionSheetPicker = A Picker + UIActionSheet_\r\n * _**iPad** ActionSheetPicker = A Picker + UIPopoverController_\r\n\r\n\r\n## Overview ##\r\nActionSheetPicker\r\n\r\nEasily present an ActionSheet with a PickerView, allowing user to select from a number of immutable options. Based on the HTML drop-down alternative found in mobilesafari.\r\n\r\nImprovements more than welcome - they are kindly requested :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Benefits ##\r\n\r\n * Spawn pickers with convenience function - delegate or reference\r\n   not required. Just provide a target/action callback.\r\n * Add buttons to UIToolbar for quick selection (see ActionSheetDatePicker below)\r\n * Delegate protocol available for more control\r\n * Universal (iPhone/iPod/iPad)\r\n\r\n## QuickStart ##\r\n\r\nThere are 4 distinct picker view options: `ActionSheetStringPicker`, `ActionSheetDistancePicker`, `ActionSheetDatePicker`, and `ActionSheetCustomPicker`. We'll focus here on how to use the `ActionSheetStringPicker` since it's most likely the one you want to use.\r\n\r\n#### Basic Usage:\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n// Inside a IBAction method:\r\n\r\n// Create an array of strings you want to show in the picker:\r\nNSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"Red\", @\"Green\", @\"Blue\", @\"Orange\", nil];\r\n\r\n[ActionSheetStringPicker showPickerWithTitle:@\"Select a Color\"\r\n                                        rows:colors\r\n                            initialSelection:0\r\n                                   doneBlock:nil\r\n                                 cancelBlock:nil\r\n                                      origin:sender];\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### But you probably want to know when something happens, huh?\r\n\r\n```obj-c\r\n// Inside a IBAction method:\r\n\r\n// Create an array of strings you want to show in the picker:\r\nNSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"Red\", @\"Green\", @\"Blue\", @\"Orange\", nil];\r\n\r\n[ActionSheetStringPicker showPickerWithTitle:@\"Select a Color\"\r\n                                        rows:colors\r\n                            initialSelection:0\r\n                                   doneBlock:^(ActionSheetStringPicker *picker, NSInteger selectedIndex, id selectedValue) {\r\n                                      NSLog(@\"Picker: %@\", picker);\r\n                                      NSLog(@\"Selected Index: %@\", selectedIndex);\r\n                                      NSLog(@\"Selected Value: %@\", selectedValue);\r\n                                    }\r\n                                 cancelBlock:^(ActionSheetStringPicker *picker) {\r\n                                      NSLog(@\"Block Picker Canceled\");\r\n                                    }\r\n                                      origin:sender];\r\n// You can also use self.view if you don't have a sender\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Screen Shots ##\r\n\r\n![ActionSheetPicker](Screenshots/string.png \"ActionSheetPicker\")\r\n![ActionSheetDatePicker](Screenshots/date.png \"ActionSheetDatePicker\")\r\n![ActionSheetDistancePicker](Screenshots/distance.png \"ActionSheetDistancePicker\")\r\n![iPad Support](Screenshots/ipad.png \"iPad Support\")\r\n\r\n## ActionSheetCustomPicker Customization\r\n\r\nActionSheetCustomPicker provides the following delegate function that can be used for customization:\r\n\r\n```obj-c\r\n- (void)actionSheetPicker:(AbstractActionSheetPicker *)actionSheetPicker configurePickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView;\r\n```\r\nThis method is called right before `actionSheetPicker` is presented and it can be used to customize the appearance and properties of the `actionSheetPicker` and the `pickerView` associated with it.\r\n\r\n## Credits ##\r\n\r\nThanks to all of the contributors for making ActionSheetPicker better for the iOS developer community.
